    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>Steve Wolgamot, inventor of the Walk A Dock<sup>&copy;</sup>, started from scratch to build the perfect dock for
        himself. Steve was tired of a lifetime of heavy, flimsy and cumbersome docks that were difficult to install
        alone. Working in his garage, Steve used his lifetime of lake experience, engineering expertise, resources and
        personal resolve to create the first Walk A Dock<sup>&copy;</sup>. White Bear Lift &amp; Dock, Inc. was then
        created to offer the Walk A Dock<sup>&copy;</sup> System to his friends, family, and neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>In recent years, Steve's neighbor, John Schlagel, purchased the business and has continued to build and install
        docks all over the greater Twin Cities area and beyond, reaching as far as New York. John and his two sons
        worked together as a family sharing responsibilities including sales, fabrication, welding, assembly, delivery
        and installation. Even though Steve is retired, he still remains our Engineering Consultant.
    </p>

    <p>After putting off retirement long enough, John decided to sell White Bear Lift &amp; Dock, Inc. to his sons after
        the 2011 season. Dave and Mark Schlagel will continue the work that Steve and John started, but also plan to
        expand, offering new services, marine repair, welding and fabrication. John will remain present as a Consultant.
    </p>

    <p>Just as it started, Walk A Dock<sup>&copy;</sup> and White Bear Lift &amp; Dock, Inc. will continue to be a
        family-owned and operated business.
